## 📌 Problem Statement  
Design and demonstrate a branching workflow strategy in Git that supports feature development, pull requests, and controlled merges to the main branch.

---

## ⚙️ Solution Approach  
- Defined a branching strategy (`branching-strategy.md`) to ensure clean code flow.  
  - **Main branch** → production-ready code.  
  - **Develop branch** → integration of new features.  
  - **Feature branches** → short-lived branches for individual tasks.  
- Created sample **feature branches**, committed changes, and raised **pull requests**.  
- Demonstrated **code review + merge process** back into `develop` and `main`.  
- Captured screenshots of PR creation, approvals, and merges to show workflow execution.
