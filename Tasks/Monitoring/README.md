## üìå Problem Statement
Enable monitoring for the AKS-based application and configure alerts (e.g., CPU and memory thresholds). Provide screenshots of Azure Monitor setup, alert rule configurations, and alert logs.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Approach
- Verified **Container Insights** is enabled for the AKS cluster (Log Analytics + Azure Monitor).
- Created alert rules for **High CPU** and **High Memory** at the appropriate scope (cluster/node pool/pod).
- Configured **action groups** to send email notifications.
- Validated alerts by observing a triggered alert and confirming email notification delivery.

## ‚úÖ Proof of Execution
- **Monitoring Enabled:** `screenshots/container-insights.png` displays active metrics/health for the AKS cluster via Container Insights.  
- **Alert Rules Configured:** `screenshots/alert-rules.png` lists CPU/Memory alert rules; `screenshots/alert-rule-details.png` shows the exact threshold and aggregation settings.  
- **Alert Fired:** `screenshots/alert-triggered.png` shows a triggered alert instance with timestamp and severity.  
- **Notification Working:** `screenshots/email-alert-triggered.png` confirms the email action group delivered the alert notification.
