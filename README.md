# ABB DevOps Technical Assessment

## üìå Overview

This repository contains my solutions to the **ABB Software Engineer ‚Äì DevOps Offline Technical Assessment**.
It covers CI/CD pipelines, Terraform-based AKS deployment, Helm chart deployment, monitoring, and security integrations.

The repo is structured task-wise for clarity, and each folder includes:
* Source code / configuration files
* Logs & screenshots of execution
* A mini-README explaining the task and approach
